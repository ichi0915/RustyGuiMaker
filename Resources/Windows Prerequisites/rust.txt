info: updating existing rustup installation


Rust is installed now. Great!

To get started you need Cargo's bin directory (%USERPROFILE%\.cargo\bin) in
your PATH environment variable. Future applications will automatically have the
correct environment, but you may need to restart your current shell.

Press the Enter key to continue.
